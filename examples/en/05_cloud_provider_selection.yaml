title: "Choose AWS as our cloud provider"
date: "2026-01-02"
decider: "Product / Engineering"
context: |
  We need to pick a cloud provider (IaaS/PaaS) for a new product.

  Assumptions / constraints:
  - We want to start production operations quickly (keep early ops load low)
  - We need to answer security/audit questions from customers and partners
  - The team has more hands-on experience with AWS; limited experience with Azure
  - We want a path to standardize operations as the product grows
why: |
  We prioritize speed-to-production and operational reliability.
  AWS matches the team's existing experience, which reduces setup time and risk.
  It also has well-known best practices and common reference material for security and audit discussions.
decision: |
  Default to AWS for new production environments.
  If an exception is needed (customer requirements, data residency/regulation, cost structure, etc.), create a separate DR to decide.
alternatives: |
  - Azure: strong integration with Microsoft ecosystem, but may slow initial setup due to team familiarity
  - GCP: strong data/analytics offering, but not the primary need for initial launch
  - Multi-cloud: improves redundancy, but increases design and operational complexity early on
consequences: |
  - Increased dependency on AWS
  - Additional evaluation may be required if Azure becomes a customer requirement
  - Ongoing cost controls are needed (tagging, budgets, alerts)
